# Seven Piece

Getting started:

To get started right away, download and use Docker to run all required components (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker).


Once Docker is up and running use the following command in the root directory:
```
docker-compose up --build -d
```

Then, navigate to localhost:8000 to access the game.
